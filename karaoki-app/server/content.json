Sett i gang, daaa! \n - Mæææ \n Woohoo, gravemaskin \n Stor, sterk og kjempefin \n Woohoo, gravemaskin \n Grav med din gravemaskin \n Én er god å ha når du bygger en bro \n Er jobben stor må du ha to \n De gjør bakken klar når man skal bygge et hus \n Ja enten bakken er av stein eller grus \n Diesel og bensin \n Stor, sterk og kjempefin \n Grav dypt i fantasi’n \n Grav med din gravemaskin \n Woohoo, gravemaskin \n Stor, sterk og kjempefin \n Woohoo, gravemaskin \n Grav med din gravemaskin \n Woohoo, gravemaskin \n Stor, sterk og kjempefin \n Woohoo, gravemaskin \n Grav med din gravemaskin",

Am I trapped in here \n Is this real? I cannot remember \n There was a manuscript it held a key \n A vicious cycle I must not surrender to \n Echo scenes to seek out \n Again and again \n Until I figure it out \n To bring this song to its end",
